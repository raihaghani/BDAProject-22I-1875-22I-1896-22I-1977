Music Recommendation System:
In developing the music recommendation system, we have leveraged a combination of web technologies and data processing tools to create a seamless and interactive music streaming experience. 
Phase 1: ETL Pipeline
The objective was to extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline utilizing the provided dataset and perform feature extraction through Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), spectral centroid, and zero-crossing rate to convert audio into numerical/vector formats along with using MongoDB to store the transformed data, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
Phase 2: Music Recommendation Model
The objective was to train a music recommendation model using the data stored in MongoDB using Apache Spark and PyTorch along with ANN algorithm and get parametres required to access model effectiveness.
Phase 3: Deployment
The objective was to develop a web-based music streaming application using Flask and integrate real-time music recommendation using Apache Kafka.
These were the objectives that were required to be fulfilled and we tried well to get the most of it.
